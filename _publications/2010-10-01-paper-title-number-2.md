# Fixed Coefficients Random Utility (Demand) Estimation

This notebook reviews the estimation and inference of a **linear** random utility model when the agent is facing a finite number of alternatives.

## Introduction
Consider a set of $J+1$ alternatives $\{0,1,2,...,J\}$. The utility that decision maker (DM) $i$ receives from buying projusct $j$ is
$$ u_{ij} = x_{ij}' \beta -\alpha p_j + \xi_j+ \epsilon_{ij}.$$
The DM maximizes her utility
$$y_i =\arg \min_{j} u_{ij}.$$
